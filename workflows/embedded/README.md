# Embedded Systems Workflows
Workflows for hardware abstraction, driver development, and memory-constrained environments.

## Workflows
- [Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Gen](hal-generator.mwc.yaml): Generate C code to abstract hardware registers.
- [Memory Leak Finder (Embedded)](embedded-mem-audit.mwc.yaml): Analyze C/C++ code for leaks in non-OS environments.
